# Mysql-database-creation
I created a database in mysql from scratch
The database contains details about employees in a company. From the data definition language(DDL) to the data manipulation language(DML) the steps are clearly shown. How to define the datatype and column constraints in the DDL processes to how you can retrieve data from your database using queries.How to define table constraints and create a relationship between two or more tables using the foreign is looked into
Within the database i explored the advanced SQL where i looked at features like views, triggers, functions,procedures and cursors.
While working on this project i learned how to create a database when situation arises and moreso i got to cover the advanced features of functions, procedures and situations to use them when working on a project
